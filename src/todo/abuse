{'en': {'shortDesc': 'SDL port of the Abuse action game', 'pkgName': 'abuse', 'longDesc': u"A classic 2D side-scrolling shoot-em-up action game from Crack dot Com.\n\nYour character is a cyborg escaping from an underground prison where several inmates have transformed into mutants after being infected with a substance called Abuse.  You move through a building complex fighting enemies and defense systems you encounter on the way. Initially, you start off having a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. There are also power-ups that augment your capabilities, allow you to increase your health limit, move faster, turn invisible and even fly. If you're one to get easily addicted, stay away!"}}
