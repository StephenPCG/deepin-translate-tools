{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Dock any program into the system tray', 'pkgName': 'alltray', 'longDesc': u'With AllTray you can dock any application with no native tray icon (like Evolution, Thunderbird, Terminals) into the system tray. A high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button will minimize back to system tray. It works well with GNOME, KDE, Xfce 4*, Fluxbox* and WindowMaker*. (*) No drag \'n drop support. Enable with "-nm" option.'}}
