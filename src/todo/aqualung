Files encoded with FLAC (the Free Lossless Audio Codec), Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, MPEG Audio (including the infamous MP3 format) and MOD audio formats (MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.), Musepack are also supported.\n\nThe program can play the music through OSS, ALSA or using the JACK Audio Connection Kit.\n\nAqualung supports the LADSPA 1.1 plugin standard. You can use any suitable plugin to enhance the music you are listening to.'}}
