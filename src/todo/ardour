{'en': {'shortDesc': 'digital audio workstation (graphical gtk2 interface)', 'pkgName': 'ardour', 'longDesc': u'Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio workstation (DAW).  It can be used to control, record, edit and run complex audio setups.\n\nArdour supports pro-audio interfaces through the ALSA project, which provides high quality, well designed device drivers and API\'s for audio I/O under Linux. Any interface supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many others.\n\nArdour has support for 24 bit samples using floating point internally, non-linear editing with unlimited undo, a user-configurable mixer, MTC master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware control surface compatibility.\n\nIt supports MIDI Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller and many modern digital mixers.\n\nArdour contains a powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is completely non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select, cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can save independent "versions" of a track or an entire piece\n\nArdour\'s editor supports the community-developed LADSPA plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another strip.\n\nArdour\'s channel capacity is limited only by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk subsystem to stream the data back and forth.\n\nJACK (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications and/or hardware audio interfaces.\n\nArdour is sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits, and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE floating point format.\n\nFurther information can be found at <http://ardour.org/>.'}}
