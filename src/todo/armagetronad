{'en': {'shortDesc': '3D Tron-like high speed game', 'pkgName': 'armagetronad', 'longDesc': u'The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped) and have to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to get your opponent to run into them.\n\nThe idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this is your chance.\n\nArmagetron Advanced can be played against AI opponents, against other humans over the network, or a mixture of both.'}}
