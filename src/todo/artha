{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Handy off-line thesaurus based on WordNet', 'pkgName': 'artha', 'longDesc': u'Artha is a off-line English thesaurus with distinct features like:\n * hot-key press word look-up (select text on any window and press\n   a preset hot-key for look-up)\n * regular expressions based search (broaden search using wild-cards\n   like *, ?, etc.)\n * passive desktop notifications (of word definitions for\n   uninterrupted work-flow)\n * spelling suggestions (when the exact spelling is vague/not known)\nOnce launched, it monitors for a preset hot-key combination. When some text is selected on any window and the hot-key is pressed, it pops-up with the word looked-up. Should the user prefer passive notifications, this can be done by enabling the notifications option.\n\nWhen the term looked for is vague/not known, then either the search can be broadened with the use of regular expressions (*, ?, etc.) in the search string or spelling suggestions when a term is incorrect.\n\nFor regular expressions based search to work, wordnet-sense-index package is required.'}}
