{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Applet to select the default ALSA sound card', 'pkgName': 'asoundconf-gtk', 'longDesc': u'Based on asoundconf code, but as a GTK+ front-end. Useful if you have two cards, and switch between the two. There is already this functionality in GNOME, but this is indeed useful if you do not use that desktop environment, and asoundconf-gtk also supports PulseAudio toggling.'}}
