{'en': {'shortDesc': 'field-theory motivated computer algebra system', 'pkgName': 'cadabra', 'longDesc': u'Cadabra is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many more. The input format is a subset of TeX.'}}
