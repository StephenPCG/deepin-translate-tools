{'en': {'shortDesc': 'mail checker for the GNOME desktop', 'pkgName': 'cgmail', 'longDesc': u"This application intends to replace old mail checkers getting integrated correctly inside GNOME desktops. It requires D-Bus and notification-daemon support (org.freedesktop.Notifications service) for any kind of notifications and the GNOME keyring to store user's credentials. gGmail will pop-up on the top right side of your desktop and after providing every information requested for accessing each of your email accounts, it will start up sending notifications when a new mail hits one of your mailboxes. This package is similar to xbiff but has some more features like pop3 and GMail account's support."}}
