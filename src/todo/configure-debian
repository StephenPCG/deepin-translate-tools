{'en': {'shortDesc': 'central configuration program for packages using debconf', 'pkgName': 'configure-debian', 'longDesc': u"configure-debian is a program which presents a list of packages which use Debconf, Debian's configuration management system.\n\nDebconf provides first-time installation wizards that run when a package is installed. You may reconfigure these packages at a later time, if you wish, and configure-debian makes that very easy.\n\nconfigure-debian splits the package lists into the subsections which make up the Debian archive, such as x11, base, gnome, or kde."}}
