{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A graphical predictive text input system', 'pkgName': 'dasher', 'longDesc': u'Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,\n\n* on a palmtop computer\n* on a wearable computer\n* when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball,\nor mouse\n* when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by\neyetracker).\nThe eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse, experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.\n\nDasher uses a more advanced prediction algorithm than the T9(tm) system often used in mobile phones, making it sensitive to surrounding context.'}}
