{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A media-rich model, simulation construction kit and authoring tool', 'pkgName': 'etoys', 'longDesc': u'Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end-users that runs on many platforms, and is free and open source. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, pres-entations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.\n\n??This is the Squeak image developed for the OLPC project.'}}
