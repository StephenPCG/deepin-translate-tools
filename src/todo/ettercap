{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN', 'pkgName': 'ettercap', 'longDesc': u"Ettercap supports active and passive dissection of many protocols (even ciphered ones) and includes many feature for network and host analysis.\n\nData injection in an established connection and filtering (substitute or drop a packet) on the fly is also possible, keeping the connection synchronized.\n\nMany sniffing modes were implemented to give you a powerful and complete sniffing suite. It's possible to sniff in four modes: IP Based, MAC Based, ARP Based (full-duplex) and PublicARP Based (half-duplex).\n\nIt has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or not, and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive) to let you know the geometry of the LAN."}}
