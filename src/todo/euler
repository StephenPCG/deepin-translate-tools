{'en': {'shortDesc': 'interactive mathematical programming environment', 'pkgName': 'euler', 'longDesc': u'Euler is a powerful numerical laboratory with a programming language. The system can handle real, complex and interval numbers, vectors and matrices. It can produce 2D/3D plots.\n\nEuler features among other things:\n* real, complex and interval scalars and matrices\n* a programming language, with local variables, default values for\n  parameters, variable parameter number, passing of functions\n* two and three dimensional graphs\n* marker plots\n* density and contour plots\n* animations\n* numerical integration and differentiation\n* statistical functions and tests\n* differential equations\n* interval methods with guaranteed inclusions\n* function minimizers (Brent, Nelder-Mean)\n* simplex algorithm\n* interpolation and approximation\n* finding roots of polynomials\n* fast Fourier transform (FFT)\n* an exact scalar product using a long accumulator\n* PostScript graphics export\nThis package contains the main program. Documentation for Euler is included in the euler-doc package.'}}
