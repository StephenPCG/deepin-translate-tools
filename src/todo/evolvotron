{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Generator of textures through interactive evolution', 'pkgName': 'evolvotron', 'longDesc': u'This is an interactive generative art application to evolve images/textures/patterns/animations through an iterative process of random mutation and user-selection driven evolution. This process is also often referred to as "evolutionary art" or "genetic art". If you like lava lamps, and still think the Mandelbrot set is cool, this could be the software for you.'}}
