{'en': {'shortDesc': 'X/GTK+ FTP client - Free Open FTP Face', 'pkgName': 'foff', 'longDesc': u"Free Open FTP Face is a lightweight graphical (GTK+) FTP client written in Python.\n\nFOFF has a built-in terminal, text viewer, image viewer, audio player, checksums and one-click gzip (de)compression. The idea behind the built-in tools, is that regardless of the operating system, you can instantly preview files or perform common operations, since there's no overhead from loading an external program. With the exception of the (optional) audio player, these built in features do not add any dependencies."}}
