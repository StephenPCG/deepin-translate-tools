{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GNOME interface for configuring the Foomatic printer filter system', 'pkgName': 'foomatic-gui', 'longDesc': u"Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems). It provides the 'glue' between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and the printer, by providing information about how to process files sent to the printer.\n\nThis package includes a GNOME-based graphical user interface to simplify configuring printers that use Foomatic.\n\nnetcat, pconf-detect, nmap, and smbclient are recommended if you need to also manage remote printers."}}
