{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Framework for source code analysis of software written in C', 'pkgName': 'frama-c', 'longDesc': u'Frama-C is a framework dedicated to the analysis of the source code of software written in C.\n\nFrama-C gathers several static analysis techniques in a single collaborative framework. The collaborative approach of Frama-C allows static analyzers to build upon the results already computed by other analyzers in the framework. Thanks to this approach, Frama-C provides sophisticated tools, such as a slicer and dependency analysis.\n\nIt can be used to:\n * Validate the source code formally\n * Look for potential runtime errors\n * Audit or review it\n * Reverse engineer it to understand its structure\n * Generate formal documentation\nThis package provides the graphical user interface of Frama-c and depends on frama-c-base.'}}
