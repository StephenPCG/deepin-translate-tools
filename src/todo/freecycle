{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Plastic surgery for your audio loops', 'pkgName': 'freecycle', 'longDesc': u'This is a beat slicer, providing amplitude domain and frequency domain beat matching / zero crossing algorithms. It exports sliced audio chunks and generates a MIDI file which can be used to play the sliced loop. Freecycle also exports AKAI S5000/S6000/Z4/Z8 .AKP file to be used with your favorite sampler.\n\nFreecycle provides LADSPA interface with full control parameters automation and some quite basic but powerful routing schemas.\n\nWith traditional amplitude (scope) view, Freecycle also offers the fully integrated spectrogram view, useful for LADSPA filters visualization.\n\nFreecycle features basic OSS output and preliminary JACK layer connectivity.'}}
