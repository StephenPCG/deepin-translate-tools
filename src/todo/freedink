{'en': {'shortDesc': 'adventure and role-playing game', 'pkgName': 'freedink', 'longDesc': u'Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda, made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes the actual game editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.\n\nGNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close compatibility, under multiple platforms.\n\nThis package is a metapackage to install the game, its data and a front-end to manage game options and D-Mods.'}}
