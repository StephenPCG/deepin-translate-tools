{'en': {'shortDesc': 'free game files for the 3D game DOOM', 'pkgName': 'freedoom', 'longDesc': u'Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom II-compatible IWAD file which is Free Software.\n\nThe IWAD file is the file used by Doom which contains all the game data (graphics, sound effects, music, etc.). While the Doom source code is Free, you currently still need one of the proprietary IWAD files from id in order to play Doom. Freedoom aims to create a Free alternative.\n\nCombined with any boom compatible Doom engine (such as prboom) this will result in a complete Free Doom-based game.'}}
