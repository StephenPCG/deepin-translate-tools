{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a simple application launcher', 'pkgName': 'fuss-launcher', 'longDesc': u'This panel applet provides an application launcher developed by the FUSS project, which uses apt-xapian-index to find applications given a few keywords.\n\nSince the index also contains Debian package information, keyword search is not limited to the application name and short description provided by desktop files.\n\nYou can also drag a file into Fuss Launcher to see the applications that can open it. Fuss Launcher also remembers frequently used applications and allows to build a quick-launch list of user favourites.'}}
