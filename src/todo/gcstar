It supports many types of collections, including movies, books, games, comics, stamps, coins, and many more. You can even create your own collection type for whatever unique thing it is that you collect.\n\nDetailed information on each item can be automatically retrieved from the internet and you can store additional data, such as the location or who you've lent it to. You may also search and filter your collection by many criteria.\n\nGCstar is the successor GCfilms and is compatible to its databases. As GCfilms isn't developed any more GCstars replaces GCfilms."}}
