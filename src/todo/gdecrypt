{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GUI for mapping/mounting and creating encrypted volumes', 'pkgName': 'gdecrypt', 'longDesc': u'gdecrypt was written for making the use of decrypted partitions under Linux more easy. It currently contains a GUI written in PyGTK for decrypting/mounting, unmounting and encryption partitions or container files and it supports partitions created with truecrypt (see http://truecrypt.org for details) and LUKS.\n\nNote that truecrypt <= 4.3a is required for truecrypt support and cryptsetup with luks is required for luks support.'}}
