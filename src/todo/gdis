{'en': {'shortDesc': 'molecular and crystal model viewer', 'pkgName': 'gdis', 'longDesc': u'A GTK+ based program for the display and manipulation of isolated molecules, periodic systems and crystalline habits. It is in development, but is nonetheless fairly functional. It has the following features:\n\n* Support for several file types (CIF, BIOSYM, XYZ,\n  XTL, MARVIN, and GULP)\n* A simple molecular creation and manipulation tool\n* A dialogue for creating starting configurations for\n  molecular dynamics simulations\n* Assorted tools for visualization (geometry information,\n  region highlighting, etc.)\n* Animation of BIOSYM files (also rendered animations,\n  see below)\nGDIS also allows you to perform the following functions through other packages:\n\n* Model rendering (courtesy of POVRay)\n* Energy minimization (courtesy of GULP)\n* Morphology calculation (courtesy of cdd)\n* Space group processing (courtesy of SgInfo)\n* View the Periodic Table (courtesy of GPeriodic)\n* Load additional filetypes, such as PDB (courtesy of Babel)\n'}}
