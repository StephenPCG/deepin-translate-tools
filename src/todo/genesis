{'en': {'shortDesc': 'general-purpose neural simulator', 'pkgName': 'genesis', 'longDesc': u'GENESIS is a general purpose simulation platform which was developed to support the simulation of neural systems ranging from complex models of single neurons to simulations of large networks made up of more abstract neuronal components.\n\nGENESIS has provided the basis for laboratory courses in neural simulation at both Caltech and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. Most current GENESIS applications involve realistic simulations of biological neural systems.  Although the software can also model more abstract networks, other simulators are more suitable for backpropagation and similar connectionist modeling.'}}
