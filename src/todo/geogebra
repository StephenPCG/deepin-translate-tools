{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Dynamic mathematics software for education', 'pkgName': 'geogebra', 'longDesc': u'GeoGebra is a dynamic geometry system. You can do constructions with points, vectors, segments, lines, conic sections as well as functions and change them dynamically afterwards. On the other hand, equations and coordinates can be entered directly.\n\nSupport for many geometric constructions is provided, as well as support for many elementary calculus-based tools (derivatives, osculating circle, ...).\n\nGeoGebra files can be exported in many different formats, or as interactive applets for web pages.'}}
