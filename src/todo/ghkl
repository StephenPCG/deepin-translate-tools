{'en': {'shortDesc': 'diffractometer computation control library', 'pkgName': 'ghkl', 'longDesc': u'The hkl library is a framework for diffraction computation and diffractometer control, heavily used at the SOLEIL synchrotron. It supports various types of diffractometer geometry: Eulerian 4-circle, Eulerian 6-circle, kappa 4-circle, kappa 6-circle, and z-axis geometry. For each of these it provides several numerically computed modes, such as bisector and constant psi.\n\nThis package provides a gui on top of the hkl library.'}}
