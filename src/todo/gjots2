{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A simple jotter (outline processor) for X11/gtk-gnome', 'pkgName': 'gjots2', 'longDesc': u"gjots2 is a fairly simple jotter (outline processor) application for your desktop.\n\nYou can use gjots2 to organize your jottings into a tree structure, adding thoughts and miscellany as you go. You can get it to spit out HTML, XML, postscript, pdf, man, etc if you want (see the online manual for an example of the HTML conversion).\n\nSome people use it for notes, personal bits and pieces, recipes, docbook XML documents and even PINs and passwords (encrypted with ccrypt(1), openssl(1) or gpg(1)).\n\nIt's a bit like the KDE program kjots but it uses the GTK-2 library."}}
