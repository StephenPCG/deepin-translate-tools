{'en': {'shortDesc': 'three-dimensional finite element mesh generator', 'pkgName': 'gmsh', 'longDesc': u"Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test cases with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities.\n\nGmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.\n\nSee Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's capabilities."}}
