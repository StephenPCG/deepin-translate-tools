{'en': {'shortDesc': 'graphical or console backgammon program with analysis', 'pkgName': 'gnubg', 'longDesc': u'GNU Backgammon is a strong backgammon program (world-class with a bearoff database installed) usable either as an engine by other programs or as a standalone backgammon game.  In addition to supporting simple play, it also has extensive analysis features, a tutor mode, adjustable difficulty, and support for exporting annotated games.  It can be played either from a GTK+ graphical interface, optionally with a 3D board, or from a simple text console.\n\nGNU Backgammon is still under initial development and should be considered beta software.'}}
