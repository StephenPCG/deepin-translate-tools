{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Allows you to attach to an already running Emacs', 'pkgName': 'gnuserv', 'longDesc': u"gnuserv allows you to attach to an already running Emacs. This allows external programs to make use of Emacs' editing capabilities. It is like GNU Emacs' emacsserver/server.el, but has many more features.\n\nYou do not need this package if you use XEmacs; it already includes gnuserv and gnuclient. If you want to use gnuserv with both GNU Emacs and XEmacs, you will only be able to use the alternative /usr/bin/gnuclient with one flavor of emacs; you will have to use either gnuclient.xemacs or gnuclient.emacs for the other flavor."}}
