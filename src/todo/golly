{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Game of Life simulator using hashlife algorithm', 'pkgName': 'golly', 'longDesc': u"Golly simulates Conway's Game of Life with an arbitrarily large grid of cells.  It can optionally use a hashlife algorithm, which allows it to rapidly compute generations for huge patterns, and to compute many generations into the future at a time.\n\nGolly provides a graphical interface for viewing and editing cellular automata.  It supports copy and paste, zoom, auto-fit, multiple layers, and viewing different areas of a pattern simultaneously in different areas of a window.\n\nGolly can load patterns from RLE, Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, and macrocell file formats; it can also interpret images as Life patterns.  Golly provides integrated help, including a copy of the Life Lexicon.\n\nGolly also supports other rules for 2D cellular automata with an 8-cell neighborhood, and supports 1D cellular automata."}}
