{'en': {'shortDesc': 'utility to search Google via your GNOME menu/panel', 'pkgName': 'googlizer', 'longDesc': u"This is a very simple and very handy utility that just spawns the configured GNOME browser with a Google search on whatever you have in the X clipboard (whatever you last selected). It's not even an applet, just a program with a launcher that's nice to put on the panel - drag it there from the menu. It also includes support for a command line option -u/--url, to specify an alternative URL to which the search should be appended before opening."}}
