{'en': {'shortDesc': 'simple puzzle game involving untangling planar graphs', 'pkgName': 'gplanarity', 'longDesc': u'gPlanarity is a puzzle game with the goal to untangle planar graphs for fun and prizes. If you tend to get addicted to cute little math  puzzles, this one is a doozy.\n\ngPlanarity is a super-clone of the flash Planarity game written by John Tantalo. The original Planarity ran well in IE and Firefox on other platforms, but was slow and liked to lock up or abort under Linux browsers.\n\ngPlanarity implements gameplay identical to the original Planarity but adds some UI and game extras around the basic game such as multiple board generation algorithms, puzzle boards, complete backing state, group select/drag and so on.'}}
