{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Satellite tracking program', 'pkgName': 'gpredict', 'longDesc': u"Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking program for GNOME, based on the tracking engine of John Magliacane's excellent satellite tracker Predict.\n\nGpredict includes the following features:\n\n* Tracking an infinite number of satellites only limited by the\n  physical memory and processing power of the computer.\n* Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any\n  combination of these.\n* You can have many modules open at the same either in a\n  notebook or in their own windows. The module can also run in\n  full-screen mode.\n* You can use many ground stations. Ground station coordinates\n  can either be entered manually or you can get some appriximate values\n  from a list with more than 2000 predefined locations worldwide.\n* Predict upcoming passes for satellites, including passes where a\n  satellite may be visible and communication windows\n* Very detailed information about both the real time data and the\n  predicted passes.\n* Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and\n  backward), and manual time control.\n* Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld.\n* Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld.\n"}}
