{'en': {'shortDesc': 'tool to create, manipulate and study graphs', 'pkgName': 'graphthing', 'longDesc': u"Some of the features of GraphThing are:\n\n* Adding, deleting and moving of vertices and edges.\n* Loading and saving of graphs.\n* Graph complements, induced subgraphs and line graphs.\n* Quick creation of many common graphs (complete, cycle, null, star, etc.).\n* Determination of shortest path, connectivity and Eulericity.\n* BFS, DFS and Minimum Spanning Tree.\n* Adjacency matrix (including exponents) and degree sequence.\n* Chromatic polynomial and chromatic number.\n* Network algorithms: Maximum network flow.\nThese `graphs' are mathematical objects that describe relationships between sets; they are not 2D plots, charts, or anything similar to that.\n\nAt the moment, only simple graphs and digraphs are supported; that is, no multiple edges or loops.  Other than this, GraphThing can handle every type of graph."}}
