{'en': {'shortDesc': 'clone of Gravity Force', 'pkgName': 'gravitywars', 'longDesc': u'Gravity Wars is inspired by Gravity Force, one of the greatest games for the Amiga. This version is a little different, with a much higher resolution, and better graphics.\n\nThe aim of the game is to guide a spaceship using only thrust and orientation to the exit, fighting against gravity and inertia. It includes some new features like water, exploding doors, bonus objects, fans (ie. wind), and some other special effects like exploding bullets and splashing water.\n\nGravity Wars is no longer maintained upstream and this Debian package should be considered the current upstream version.'}}
