{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A GUI to produce PDFs or DjVus from scanned documents', 'pkgName': 'gscan2pdf', 'longDesc': u'Only two clicks are required to scan several pages and then save all or a selection as a PDF or DjVu file, including metadata if required.\n\ngscan2pdf can control regular or sheet-fed (ADF) scanners with SANE via scanimage or scanadf, and can scan multiple pages at once. It presents a thumbnail view of scanned pages, and permits simple operations such as cropping, rotating and deleting pages.\n\nOCR can be used to recognise text in the scans, and the output embedded in the PDF or DjVu.\n\nPDF conversion is done by PDF::API2.\n\nThe resulting document may be saved as a PDF, DjVu, multipage TIFF file, or single page image file.'}}
