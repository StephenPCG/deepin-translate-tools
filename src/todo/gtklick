{'en': {'shortDesc': 'simple metronome GUI for JACK', 'pkgName': 'gtklick', 'longDesc': u'gtklick is a simple metronome with an easy-to-use GTK+ interface, supporting the JACK sound server.\n\nIt features different sounds to choose from, arbitrary meters and beat patterns, a speed trainer, and the ability to save and restore profiles. gtklick is implemented as a frontend to klick and uses OSC messages to communicate with the backend.\n\nUsing klick directly on the command line offers additional features like tempo maps and synchronization with JACK transport.'}}
