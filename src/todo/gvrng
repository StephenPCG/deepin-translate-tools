{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Interactive, introductory programming language', 'pkgName': 'gvrng', 'longDesc': u"Guido van Robot Next Generation (GvRng) is a project developed by advanced high school students for use by their peers as a learning tool and precursor to the further study of programming with Python. It is a minimalistic programming language providing just enough syntax to help students learn the concepts of sequencing, conditional branching, looping and procedural abstraction.\n\nIt's biggest strength is that it permits this learning in an environment that combines the thrill of problem-solving with instant visual feedback. In short, it is an interactive, introductory programming language that is excellent for learning the basic concepts of programming, applicable in any high-level language.\n\nThe GvRng version replaces the old GvR program that used wxPython for the GUI."}}
