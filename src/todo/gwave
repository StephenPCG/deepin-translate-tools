{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a waveform viewer eg for spice simulators', 'pkgName': 'gwave', 'longDesc': u'Gwave is a tool for viewing analog data, such as the output of Spice simulations.\n\nGwave can read "raw" files from spice2G6, spice3F5 or ngspice, and a tabular ASCII format suitable for use with GnuCAP or homegrown tools. It can also read several binary and ascii files written by commercial spice-type simulators such as hspice, tspice, and nanosim.\n\nIt supports multiple "panels" (graticules) with multiple variables displayed in each. Two vertical-bar cursors are available for time-difference measurements. Multiple files can be loaded, for comparing results of several simulations.'}}
