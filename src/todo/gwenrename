{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Batch renamer tool for KDE', 'pkgName': 'gwenrename', 'longDesc': u'GwenRename is a series renamer tool. It was created as an external tool for GwenView, the image viewer for KDE, but can also be used from Konqueror. As that, the files to be renamed are passed to it as command line parameters, and there is no other way to load files into it. The main goal is to have a batch renaming tool that\'s easy and light enough for every day use. If you are looking for a more compound and featured renaming tool, you should have a look at Dominik Seichter\'s "KRename".'}}
