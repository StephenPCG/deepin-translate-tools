{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Displays time and date in specified time zones', 'pkgName': 'gworldclock', 'longDesc': u'This program displays the time and date of specified time zones using a GTK+ interface. It also provides a "rendezvous" function allowing the zones to be synchronised to a time other than the current time. This can help you organise meetings across different timezones.\n\nThe time zones may be entered by hand in TZ format or chosen from a list prepared from /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  The zone list is kept in a format consistent with the shell script tzwatch.'}}
