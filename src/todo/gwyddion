{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Scanning Probe Microscopy visualization and analysis tool', 'pkgName': 'gwyddion', 'longDesc': u"Gwyddion is a modular program for Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) data visualization and analysis. It is primarily intended for analysis of height field data obtained by microscopy techniques like Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (SNOM or NSOM) and others. However, it can be used for arbitrary height field and image analysis.\n\nThis package contains the main application and its modules. It also contains a GNOME (and Xfce) thumbnailer which creates previews for all file types known to Gwyddion.\n\nGwyddion's Python scripting interface Pygwy is also included."}}
