{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a powerful tool for visualizing 3-dimensional data sets', 'pkgName': 'ifrit', 'longDesc': u'IFRIT (the Ionization FRont Interactive Tool) has its origins (and hence name) in a specialized utility designed to visualize ionization fronts in cosmological numerical simulations.  IFRIT, however, has outgrown its origins and now can visualize general data sets as well.\n\nIFRIT is written in C++ and is based on two state-of-the-art toolkits: the Visualization ToolKit (VTK) and a GUI toolkit QT.'}}
