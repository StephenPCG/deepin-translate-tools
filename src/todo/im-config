{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Input method configuration framework', 'pkgName': 'im-config', 'longDesc': u"im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch the input method on X Window System. This input method is the essential mechanism for Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII native characters.\n\nMany modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.\n\nBy installing this package, the most desirable input method and its backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK+ input method module and Qt input method module.\n\nYou can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command."}}
