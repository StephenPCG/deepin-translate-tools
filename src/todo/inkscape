{'en': {'shortDesc': 'vector-based drawing program', 'pkgName': 'inkscape', 'longDesc': u'Inkscape loads and saves a subset of the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format, a standard maintained by the WWW consortium.\n\nInkscape user interface should be familiar from CorelDraw and similar drawing programs. There are rectangles, ellipses, text items, bitmap images and freehand curves. As an added bonus, both vector and bitmap objects can have alpha transparency and can be arbitrarily transformed.\n\nInkscape supports multiple opened files and multiple views per file. Graphics can be printed and exported to png bitmaps.\n\nSome of the import and export features are provided using the packages dia, libwmf-bin, pstoedit, skencil, imagemagick, and perlmagick.\n\nOther extensions use ruby, libxml-xql-perl, python-numpy, and python-lxml. You must have these packages to make full use of all extensions and effects.\n\nIf you want to use the spellchecker, you have to install aspell and the respective language-pack, e.g. aspell-en or aspell-de.'}}
