{'en': {'shortDesc': 'semi-automatic segmentation of structures in 3D images', 'pkgName': 'itksnap', 'longDesc': u'SNAP provides semi-automatic segmentation of structures in medical images (e.g.  magnetic resonance images of the brain) using active contour methods, as well as manual delineation and image navigation. Noteworthy features are:\n\n* Linked cursor for seamless 3D navigation\n* Manual segmentation in three orthogonal planes at once\n* Support for many different 3D image formats, including NIfTI\n* Support for concurrent, linked viewing and segmentation of multiple images\n* Limited support for color images (e.g., diffusion tensor maps)\n* 3D cut-plane tool for fast post-processing of segmentation results\n'}}
