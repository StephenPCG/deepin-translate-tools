{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Java morphing film-make program for pixel picture-input', 'pkgName': 'javamorph', 'longDesc': u'Give two human-face pictures as inputs into the program. Then mark important locations whithin both faces by pairs of corresponding points. The program will create a short enumerated picture series in which the left face moves (morphs) into the right one. You can then create a MPEG (see mencoder) from the picture series. An animated GIF (see GIMP) is also possible.'}}
