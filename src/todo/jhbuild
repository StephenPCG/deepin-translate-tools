{'en': {'shortDesc': 'flexible build script for package collections', 'pkgName': 'jhbuild', 'longDesc': u"Jhbuild is a program that can be used to pull a number of modules from CVS, Subversion, Bazaar and other types of repositories or from tarballs and build them in the correct order.  Unlike some build scripts, jhbuild lets you specify what modules you want built and it will then go and build those modules plus dependencies.\n\nAlthough jhbuild was originally developed to build GNOME, it is now able to build a number of the modules in freedesktop.org's CVS. Extending it to handle new modules is usually trivial assuming the build infrastructure matches the other modules it handles."}}
