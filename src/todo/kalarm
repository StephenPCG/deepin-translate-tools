{'en': {'shortDesc': 'alarm message, command and email scheduler', 'pkgName': 'kalarm', 'longDesc': u"KAlarm provides a graphical interface to schedule personal timed events - pop-up alarm messages, command execution and sending emails. There is a range of options for configuring recurring events.\n\nA pop-up alarm can show either a simple text message, or the contents of a text or image file. It can optionally be spoken, or play a sound file. You can choose its appearance, and set reminders. Among KAlarm's other facilities, you can set up templates to allow KAlarm to be used as a 'tea timer'.\n\nThis package is part of the KDE PIM module."}}
