{'en': {'shortDesc': 'visualisation tool for the Valgrind profiler', 'pkgName': 'kcachegrind', 'longDesc': u'KCachegrind is a visualisation tool for the profiling data generated by calltree, a memory profiling tool for valgrind.  Any executable can be profiled using calltree without being recompiled, including multi-threaded applications, shared libraries, and plugins.\n\nFor visualising the output from profiling tools other than Valgrind, several converters can be found in the kcachegrind-converters package.\n\nThis package is part of the KDE Software Development Kit module.'}}
