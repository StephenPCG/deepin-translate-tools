{'en': {'shortDesc': 'game of space battle', 'pkgName': 'kobodeluxe', 'longDesc': u"Kobo Deluxe is a third person scrolling 2D shooter with a simple and responsive control system - which you'll need to tackle the tons of enemy ships that shoot at you, chase you, circle around you shooting, or even launch other ships at you, while you're trying to destroy the labyrinth shaped bases. There are 50 action packed levels with smoothly increasing difficulty, and different combinations of enemies that require different tactics to be dealt with successfully. It's loads of classical arcade style fun."}}
