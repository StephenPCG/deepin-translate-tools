{'en': {'shortDesc': 'WYSIWYG CD cover printer', 'pkgName': 'kover', 'longDesc': u'Kover is a WYSIWYG CD cover printer. You have the ability to enter the title, contents, set background colors, enter text, embed images or stream the title and tracks from CDDB (including CDDB Code 211). Kover can authenticate through a proxy (Basic, but not Digest) for accessing CDDB, and make a CDDB request just by entering the CDDB ID (i.e., no need to have the CD inserted).'}}
