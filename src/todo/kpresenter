{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a presentation program for the KDE Office Suite', 'pkgName': 'kpresenter', 'longDesc': u'KPresenter is an easy to use yet still flexible presentation application. You can easily create presentations containing a rich variety of elements, from graphics to text, from charts to images. KPresenter is extensible through a plugin system, so it is easy to add new effects, new content elements or even new ways of managing your presentation. KPresenter natively uses the OpenDocument file format standard, for easy interchange with all ODF supporting applications which includes Microsoft Office. Some examples of easy-to-use features are support for layouts, a special slide overview view during presentations for the presenter, support for many different master sliders in one presentation, cool transitions and a useful notes feature.\n\nThis package is part of the KDE Office Suite.'}}
