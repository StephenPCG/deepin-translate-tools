{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a pixel-based image manipulation program for the KDE Office Suite', 'pkgName': 'krita', 'longDesc': u'Krita is a creative application for raster images. Whether you want to create from scratch or work with existing images, Krita is for you. You can work with photos, scanned images or start for a blank slate. Krita supports most graphics tablets out of the box.\n\nKrita is different from other graphics design programs in that it has pluggable brush engines, some supporting brush resources like Gimp brush files, and other offering sophisticated simulation of real brushes, and others again offering deforming your image or mixing colors. Moreover, Krita has full support for graphics tablets, including features as pressure, tilt and rate, making it a great choice for artists. There are easy to use tools for drawing lines, ellipses and rectangles, and the freehand tool is supported by pluggable ??drawing assistants?? that help you draw shapes that still have a freehand feeling to them.\n\nThis package is part of the KDE Office Suite.'}}
