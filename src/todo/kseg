{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Sketchpad for planar Euclidean geometry', 'pkgName': 'kseg', 'longDesc': u'KSEG allows you to interactively create a geometrical construction, similar to what you can do with a straight edge and compass.  Points may be inserted on the page with right mouse-button clicks, and then used to form segments, lines, circles, or other geometrical objects. At any time you can drag existing points around, and watch how the constructed objects respond.'}}
