{'en': {'shortDesc': 'KDE-based next generation IRC client with module support', 'pkgName': 'kvirc', 'longDesc': u"A highly configurable graphical IRC client with an MDI interface, built-in scripting language, support for IRC DCC, drag & drop file browsing, and much more. KVIrc uses the KDE widget set, can be extended using its own scripting language, integrates with KDE, and supports custom plugins.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple and plain IRC client, KVIrc is probably the wrong choice as it is rather big. But if you want a highly customizable client you won't regret the installation."}}
