{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a tool to generate Smith Charts', 'pkgName': 'linsmith', 'longDesc': u"A Smith chart is a tool used in electrical engineering that shows how the complex impedance of a transmission line varies along its length, and simplifies the design of impedance matching networks to match the line to its load.\n\nlinSmith is a Smith Charting program, mainly designed for educational use. As such, there is an emphasis on capabilities that improve the 'showing the effect of'-style of operation.\n\nIt's main features are:\n* Definition of multiple load impedances (at different frequencies)\n* Addition of discrete (L, C, parallel and series LC, and transformer)\n  and line components (open and closed stubs, line segments)\n* Connection in series and parallel\n* Easy experimentation with values using scrollbars\n* A 'virtual' component switches from impedance to admittance to help\n  explaining (or understanding) parallel components\n* The chart works in real impedances (not normalized ones)\n* Direct view of the result on the screen\n* Ability to generate publication quality Postscript output\n* A 'log' file with textual results at each intermediate step\n* Load and circuit configuration is stored separately, permitting several\n  solutions without re-defining the other\n"}}
