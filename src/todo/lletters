{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GTK letters-learning game for small children', 'pkgName': 'lletters', 'longDesc': u"This is based on author's daughter's (formerly) favorite game, Larry's Learning Letters and Numbers. This is a Linux replacement, written from scratch, with many improvements.  It was built using the GTK (Gimp ToolKit) for X.  It presently works with 1.0.x and 1.1.x, but images load faster with the newer library.\n\nIt is intended for children 2 and up, and is a fun learning game.  It helps younger children learn their letters and numbers, while older children will improve their spelling, and vocabulary skills.  It also helps them develop important keyboard and mouse skills too.\n\nYou can have more than one image for each word, more than one word for each letter, and you can add new images without recompiling too."}}
