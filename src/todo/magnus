{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Computational group theory software with GUI', 'pkgName': 'magnus', 'longDesc': u'The MAGNUS computational group theory package is an innovative symbolic algebra package providing facilities for doing calculations in and about infinite groups.  Almost all symbolic algebra systems are oriented toward finite computations that are guaranteed to produce answers, given enough time and resources.  By contrast, MAGNUS is concerned with experiments and computations on infinite groups which in some cases are known to terminate, while in others are known to be generally recursively unsolvable.\n\nMAGNUS features an intuitive graphical user interface, facilities for running different algorithms on the same problem in parallel, generation of approximations for working on otherwise infeasible problems, genetic algorithms and a plug-in package manager.'}}
