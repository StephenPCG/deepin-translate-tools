{'en': {'shortDesc': 'The original Mah-Jong game', 'pkgName': 'mah-jong', 'longDesc': u'This is a set of programs to play the original Mah-Jong game: one server, one client for a human player and one client for an AI player. Hence the game can be played by 1 to 4 human players.\n\nYou should keep in mind that the original Mah-Jong game has nothing to do with the well-known solitaire game. (It merely uses the same set of tiles.)\n\nIf you like the game, please consider making a donation to the (upstream) author. Read /usr/share/doc/mah-jong/README.Debian for details.'}}
