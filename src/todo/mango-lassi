{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Share mouse and pointer with other computers', 'pkgName': 'mango-lassi', 'longDesc': u"Mango-lassi lets you to share mouse and pointer with other computers using Avahi. It has features like:\n* Fully peer-to-peer. All Mango Lassi instances are both client and server\n  at the same time. Other hosts may enter or leave a running session at any\n  time.\n* No need to open X11 up for the network\n* You have a 50% chance that for your setup you don't need any configuration\n  at all. In the case of the other 50% you might need to swap the order of\n  your screens manually in a simple dialog, because Mango Lassi\n  didn't guess correctly which screen is left and which screen is right.\n* libnotify integration so that it tells you whenever a\n  desktop joins or leaves your session.\n* Shows a nice OSD on your screen when your screen's input is currently being\n  redirected to another screen.\n* Uses all those nifty GNOME APIs, like D-Bus-over-TCP, Avahi, libnotify,\n  Gtk,..\n* Supports both the X11 clipboard and the selection, supporting all content\n  types, and not just simple text -- i.e. you can copy and paste image data\n  between Gimp on your screens.\n"}}
