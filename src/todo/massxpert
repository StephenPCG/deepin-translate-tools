{'en': {'shortDesc': 'linear polymer mass spectrometry software', 'pkgName': 'massxpert', 'longDesc': u'massXpert is a program to simulate and analyse mass spectrometric data obtained on linear (bio-)polymers. It is the successor of GNU polyxmass.\n\nFour modules allow:\n- making brand new polymer chemistry definitions;\n- using the definitions to perform easy calculations in a desktop\n  calculator-like manner;\n- performing sophisticated polymer sequence editing and simulations;\n- perform m/z list comparisons;\nChemical simulations encompass cleavage (either chemical or enzymatic), gas-phase fragmentations, chemical modification of any monomer in the polymer sequence, cross-linking of monomers in the sequence, arbitrary mass searches, calculation of the isotopic pattern...'}}
