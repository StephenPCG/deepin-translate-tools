{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A highly configurable, very gaudy system load meter', 'pkgName': 'mgm', 'longDesc': u"MGM is the Moaning Goat Meter, a system load monitor along the lines of procmeter3 but much prettier (and with a much higher resource usage). It's written in Perl/Tk, uses a nice antialiased Helvetica font, is configurable with X resources, and can have a larger memory footprint than Emacs."}}
