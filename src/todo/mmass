{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Mass spectrometry tool for proteomics', 'pkgName': 'mmass', 'longDesc': u'mMass is a free mass spectrum viewer/analyzer in which the following proteomics-related tasks can be performed:\n\n- Open raw text, mzXML and mzData mass spectra;\n- Define peak lists;\n- Powerful mass spectrum viewer (zoom, cursor...);\n- Data recalibration;\n- Protein-only simulations;\n- Online Mascot searches.\nThis software is written with Python, and the author claims that writing new modules should be easy. A private module, written in C, is required for fast calculations routines in the mass spectrum plotting module.'}}
