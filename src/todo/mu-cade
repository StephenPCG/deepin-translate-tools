{'en': {'shortDesc': 'the physics centipede invasion, smashup waggly shmup', 'pkgName': 'mu-cade', 'longDesc': u"Mu-cade is another shoot-em-up game by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has introduced physics into his formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing area is a rectangular arena in which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling the others into the vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly realize the subtlety of the goal: your tail lengthens as you destroy your enemies."}}
