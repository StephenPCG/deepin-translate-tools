{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Mythbuntu Configuration Application', 'pkgName': 'mythbuntu-control-centre', 'longDesc': u'The Mythbuntu control centre is used to modify settings on a Mythbuntu system that are not necessarily MythTV specific.  These settings range from setting up system roles, to configuration of drivers, remotes, and services.\n\nThis application can also be used on a standard Ubuntu system to convert it directly to a Mythbuntu box or to add Mythbuntu role(s) in addition to the existing desktop role.'}}
