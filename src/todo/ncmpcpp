{'en': {'shortDesc': 'ncurses-based client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)', 'pkgName': 'ncmpcpp', 'longDesc': u"ncmpcpp is almost an exact clone of ncmpc which is a text-mode client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon. It provides a keyboard oriented and consistent interface to MPD and contains some new features ncmpc doesn't have. It's been also rewritten from scratch in C++.\n\nNew features include:\n- tag editor;\n- playlists editor;\n- easy to use search screen;\n- media library screen;\n- lyrics screen;\n- possibility of going to any position in currently playing track\n  without rewinding/fastforwarding;\n- multi colored main window (if you want);\n- songs can be added to playlist more than once;\n- a lot of minor useful functions.\n"}}
