{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Standalone graphical debugger for GNOME', 'pkgName': 'nemiver', 'longDesc': u'Nemiver is a project to write a standalone graphical debugger that integrates in the GNOME desktop. It features a backend which uses the well known GNU Debugger gdb to debug C/C++ programs.\n\nNemiver is built with a plugin system that can offer several different perspectives. Currently the only perspective provided is a debugging perspective, but it could be expanded with perspectives added for valgrind, or for profiling tools such as oprofile.'}}
