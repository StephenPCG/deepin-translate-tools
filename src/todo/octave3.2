{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GNU Octave language for numerical computations (3.2 branch)', 'pkgName': 'octave3.2', 'longDesc': u'Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.\n\nOctave uses some of the best and most respected numerical libraries as balgen, dassl, eispack, fftpack, lapack, linpack, minpack, odepack, ranlib, slatec-fn and villad. Octave can be dynamically extended with user-supplied C++ files.'}}
