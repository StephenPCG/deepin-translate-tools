{'en': {'shortDesc': 'PulseAudio Device Chooser', 'pkgName': 'padevchooser', 'longDesc': u'PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.\n\nThis is a simple GTK tool which registers an icon in the tray area and allows quick access to some features of the PulseAudio sound server. Specifically it can do for you:\n\n  * Notify about new sink/sources becoming available on the LAN\n  * Quickly change the default PulseAudio sink/source/server assigned to\n    the current X11 display, selecting devices available on the LAN\n  * Start the auxiliary tools PulseAudio Volume Control, PulseAudio Volume\n    Meter, PulseAudio Manager, PulseAudio Preferences\n'}}
