{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A partition management utility', 'pkgName': 'partitionmanager', 'longDesc': u'Partition Manager is a utility program to help you manage the disk devices, partitions and file systems on your computer. It allows you to easily create, copy, move, delete, resize without losing data, backup and restore partitions.\n\nPartition Manager supports a large number of file systems, including ext2/3/4, reiserfs, NTFS, FAT16/32, jfs, xfs and more. Note that to gain support for a specific file system other than ext2/3/4, you should install the corresponding suggested package.\n\nPartition Manager is based on libparted (like gparted) and makes use of the KDE libraries for its user interface.'}}
