{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Physics Analysis Workstation (Lesstif-enhanced version)', 'pkgName': 'paw++', 'longDesc': u'CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other fields such as the biological sciences.\n\nThis package includes Paw++, an interactive program for use in analysis and graphical presentation.  Paw++ is the same program as PAW (in the "paw" package), but with a more user-friendly Motif-based GUI, compiled against Lesstif in Debian.\n\nThe program is linked statically against the CERN libraries on 64-bit architectures in order to function properly, as its design is not very 64-bit clean.'}}
