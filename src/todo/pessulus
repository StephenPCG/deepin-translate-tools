{'en': {'shortDesc': 'lockdown editor for GNOME', 'pkgName': 'pessulus', 'longDesc': u'pessulus enables the system administrator to set mandatory settings in GConf, which apply to all users, restricting what they can do, which may be of particular usefulness for kiosks (internet cafes, for example).\n\nExamples of what can be locked down are the panels (no changes in the panel configuration are allowed, locking their position and their contents), some of their functions individually (disabling screen locking and log out), the web browser (disabling specific protocols, arbitrary URLs, forcing the user to be in fullscreen mode), among many others.'}}
