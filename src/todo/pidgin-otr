However,\n    _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages\n    he sees are authentic and unmodified.\n- Perfect forward secrecy\n  - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation\n    is compromised.\nThis is a pidgin plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging.'}}
