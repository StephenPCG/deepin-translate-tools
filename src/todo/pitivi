{'en': {'shortDesc': 'non-linear audio/video editor using GStreamer', 'pkgName': 'pitivi', 'longDesc': u'GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins.\n\nPiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the GStreamer framework.  PiTIVi provides several ways of creating and modifying a timeline.  Ranging from a simple synopsis view (a-la iMovie) to the full-blown editing view (aka Complex View) which puts you in complete control of your editing.'}}
