{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Create an image consisting of many small images', 'pkgName': 'pixelize', 'longDesc': u'Pixelize is a program that will use many scaled down images to try to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.\n\nPixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or duplicated) into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area is analyzed, and replaced with an image chosen from a large database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that best match each area.'}}
