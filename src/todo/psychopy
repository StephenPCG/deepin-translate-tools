{'en': {'shortDesc': 'environment for creating psychology stimuli in Python', 'pkgName': 'psychopy', 'longDesc': u'PsychoPy provides an environment for creating psychology stimuli using Python scripting language.  It combines the graphical strengths of OpenGL with easy Python syntax to give psychophysics a free and simple stimulus presentation and control package.\n\nThe goal is to provide, for the busy scientist, tools to control timing and windowing and a simple set of pre-packaged stimuli and methods.  PsychoPy features\n- High-level powerful scripting language (Python)\n- Simple syntax\n- Use of hardware-accelerated graphics (OpenGL)\n- Integration with Spectrascan PR650 for easy monitor calibration\n- Simple routines for staircase and constant stimuli experimental\n  methods as well as curve-fitting and bootstrapping\n- Simple (or complex) GUIs via wxPython\n- Easy interfaces to joysticks, mice, sound cards etc. via PyGame\n- Video playback (MPG, DivX, AVI, QuickTime, etc.) as stimuli\n'}}
