{'en': {'shortDesc': 'This is Purrr, mass file rename tool written in PyGTK', 'pkgName': 'purrr', 'longDesc': u"Purrr will let you rename multiple files according to specified template. Templates are really a miniature programming language, with variables and stuff.\n\nAll that to let you automate not-so-fun task of doing zillions of almost identical renames by hand. If you have ever downloaded anime series where files had smart names like kimi_ga_ep1_divx_mp3[23ed4xc].avi through kimi_ga_ep13_divx_mp3[4c00ddd].avi, you'll surely get the idea.\n\nHomepage: http://mathrick.org/software/purrr.html\n"}}
