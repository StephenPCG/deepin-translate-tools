{'en': {'shortDesc': 'flexible and componentized presentation program', 'pkgName': 'pyntor', 'longDesc': u'Pyntor is a small, flexible and componentized presentation program. It is built upon Python and the SDL library (via pygame). Pyntor features a wiki-like presentation component, a HTML page component (Pyromaniac), and several more. Standard features like PDF/HTML export, page selection and interactivity are available, as are advanced features such as full-text search in the presentation slides.\n\nDue to the minimal size and maximum configurability, Pyntor is a nice alternative to conventional presentation programs.'}}
