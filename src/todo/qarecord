{'en': {'shortDesc': 'audio recording tool', 'pkgName': 'qarecord', 'longDesc': u'QARecord is a simple but solid recording tool. It works well with stereo and multichannel recordings, supporting ALSA and JACK interfaces and in both 16 bit and 32 bit mode. By using a large ringbuffer for the captured data, buffer overruns are avoided. It has a Qt based GUI with graphical peak meters.'}}
