{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A development environment entirely dedicated to Qt4', 'pkgName': 'qdevelop', 'longDesc': u'It consists of a Qt project manager, a source code editor, build-automation tools by calling make command, and the gdb debugger.\n\nQDevelop aims to be easy to use and does not try to compete with more complete tools, like kdevelop, which are often too complex. Its goal is simplicity, powerfulness and a same interface on all platforms.'}}
