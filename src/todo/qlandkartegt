{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GPS mapping (GeoTiff and vector) and GPSr management', 'pkgName': 'qlandkartegt', 'longDesc': u"This package provides a versatile tool for GPS maps in GeoTiff format as well as Garmin's img vector map format. QLandkarteGT is the successor of QLandkarte. Among various improvements (e.g. 2D/3D map rendering and reduced resource demands) the major difference is its device-independent architecture, which is not limited to Garmin devices anymore. Therefore, the package also does not include device drivers. Drivers for a number of Garmin devices are available from the qlandkartegt-garmin package.\n\nAdditionally, QLandkarteGT serves as a frontend to the GDAL tools, to make georeferencing of scanned maps feasible for users. In contrast to similar tools (e.g. QGis) its straightforward interface is especially suited for non-scientific users."}}
