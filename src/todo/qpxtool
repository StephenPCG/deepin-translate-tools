{'en': {'shortDesc': 'CD/DVD quality checker', 'pkgName': 'qpxtool', 'longDesc': u'QPxTool gives you access to all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written and blank media, that are available for your drive. This will help you to find the right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which will increase the chance for a long data lifetime.\n\nQPxTool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the Q-Checks and not all of them are supported by QPxTool. Currently, most newer drives of LiteOn, NEC, Pioneer and Plextor are supported.'}}
