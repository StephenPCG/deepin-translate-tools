{'en': {'shortDesc': 'fluidsynth MIDI sound synthesiser front-end', 'pkgName': 'qsynth', 'longDesc': u'QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt 4 toolkit. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line softsynths but for the moment it wraps FluidSynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org).\n\nFluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont specification.'}}
