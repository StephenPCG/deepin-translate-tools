{'en': {'shortDesc': 'data analysis and scientific plotting', 'pkgName': 'qtiplot', 'longDesc': u'Qtiplot is a fully fledged plotting software similar to the OriginLab Origin software (See http://www.originlab.com for more information about Origin).\n\nIt can make two and three dimensional plots of publication quality, both from datasets and functions. It can do non-linear fitting and multi-peak fitting.\n\nSome Features:\n* 3D Plots.\n* Publication quality 2D plots: Error Bars, Multilayer Plots, Bar Plots,\n  Pie Plots, Vector Plots, Contour and Image Plots.\n* Statistical Plots: Box/Whiskers Diagramms, Histograms.\n* Easy export of plots to vector formats (EPS, PS, PDF) and to other various\n  image formats (BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF).\n* Powerful and versatile spreadsheets and calculations in column-logic.\n* Easy ASCII-Import/Export of single or multiple files.\n* Linear and non-linear curve fitting with weighting and estimation of\n  statistical errors of the fit-parameters, using Levenberg-Marquardt,\n  Least-Squares Algorithm or Nelder-Mead simplex minimization algorithm.\n* Multi-peak fitting with Gaussian and Lorentzian peak profiles.\n* Data analysis: statistics, sorting, FFT, data smoothing (Savitzky-Golay,\n  FFT smoothing, and moving window average), data filtering (low/high/band\n  pass and band block filters), convolution/deconvolution, correlation,\n  interpolation, numerical integration/differentiation.\n* Matrices optimized for 3D plotting.\n* Templates support: all the settings for plots (2D/3D), tables and matrixes\n  can be saved to ASCII files and restored later on for a fast editing\n  process.\n* Project files based on folders, a powerful project explorer with extensive\n  built-in features: drag and drop, searching facilities.\n'}}
