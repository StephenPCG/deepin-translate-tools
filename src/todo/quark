{'en': {'shortDesc': 'music player daemon controlled from the gnome panel or cli', 'pkgName': 'quark', 'longDesc': u'Quark is an audio player, for geeks, by geeks. It runs in the background with access provided via a FIFO in the filesystem. It uses Xine-lib for playing music, and can therefore play any file format supported by Xine.\n\nQuark comes with a couple front-ends to make it more useful:\n* charm-quark - a CLI interface\n* strange-quark - a Gnome notification area interface.\n'}}
