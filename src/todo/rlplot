{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Generate publication quality graphs', 'pkgName': 'rlplot', 'longDesc': u'RLPlot is a GUI based program for displaying scientific data in standard formats. It has full support for all error-bar types and it has greater flexibility with displaying colour and texture in charts than gnuplot (filled bar chart boxes are possible without any additional programs). Output is generated on the X display where further changes can be made to the graph using point and click methods. Images can be exported as scalable vector graphics (SVG) as well as EPS, WMF and TIFF formats.'}}
