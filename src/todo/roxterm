{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Multi-tabbed GTK/VTE terminal emulator', 'pkgName': 'roxterm', 'longDesc': u'ROXTerm is a terminal emulator based on the VTE library. It was originally intended to be a lightweight alternative to gnome-terminal, but its role has shifted to providing a richer range of features for power users. It can be used as a ROX application, as the name implies, but also integrates well with other X desktop environments such as GNOME.'}}
