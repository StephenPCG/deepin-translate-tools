{'en': {'shortDesc': 'utility to help prevent repetitive strain injury for KDE 4', 'pkgName': 'rsibreak', 'longDesc': u'Prolonged use of a mouse and keyboard can cause a repetitive strain injury (RSI), so computer users are advised to take regular breaks.\n\nRSIBreak helps prevent repetitive strain injuries by keeping track of usage patterns and periodically informing users to take breaks.  During break periods, RSIBreak can either show an unobtrusive message, lock the screen entirely, or present a slideshow.'}}
