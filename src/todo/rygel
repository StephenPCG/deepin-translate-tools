{'en': {'shortDesc': 'GNOME UPnP/DLNA services', 'pkgName': 'rygel', 'longDesc': u"Rygel is a collection of DLNA (UPnP AV) services (devices in UPnP speak), implemented through a plug-in mechanism. Important facts and features:\n * APIs to ease the implementation of AV devices (currently only\n   MediaServer V 2.0 specification).\n * Audio and Video Transcoding: source format could be anything\n   GStreamer's decodebin2 can handle but output formats are currently\n   limited to: mp3, PCM and MPEG TS. Fortunately the transcoding\n   framework is flexible enough to easily add more transcoding targets.\n * Specifically designed for GNOME (Mobile).\n * Based on GUPnP.\n * Written (mostly) in Vala language.\nThis package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:\n * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the\n   user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that\n   gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.\n * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies\n   provided by external applications.\n"}}
