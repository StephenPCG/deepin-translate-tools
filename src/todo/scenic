{'en': {'shortDesc': 'telepresence software for live performances and installations', 'pkgName': 'scenic', 'longDesc': u'Scenic is a free software suite for streaming audio, video and MIDI between live events. It was created at the Society for Arts and Technology (SAT) to give artists a powerful tool for telepresence in live arts contexts and new media installations.\n\nThe streaming is done over RTP with the GStreamer multimedia framework.  Users can choose either low-bandwidth or high-quality codecs, depending on what is available on their system. It offers up to as many audio channels as your audio device supports.\n\nThis package contains the Scenic desktop application.\n\nFor MIDI streaming support, one should install either the python-pygame package with version greater than or equal to 1.9.1release, or the python-portmidi package. If none of them is installed, all the widgets in the MIDI tab of the Scenic application will be disabled, and the midistream utility will not work at all.'}}
