{'en': {'shortDesc': 'fly aircraft to search (for) and rescue people in distress', 'pkgName': 'searchandrescue', 'longDesc': u"Tired of scores indicating things destroyed or lives snuffed? Try something different -- fly a helicopter around and rescue people in distress. If you were in trouble wouldn't you want someone to rescue you?\n\nThis game is intended for players of all audiences, but especially for mature players who want to get away from the violence and still retain a level of precise challenge. Flight difficulty can be lowered for beginners (regardless of mission type), and graphics minimized to suit slower computers (minimum Pentium 166 with no graphics acceleration)."}}
