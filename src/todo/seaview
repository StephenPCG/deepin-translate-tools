{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Multiplatform interface for sequence alignment and phylogeny', 'pkgName': 'seaview', 'longDesc': u"SeaView reads and writes various file formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE, Newick) of DNA and protein sequences and of phylogenetic trees. Alignments can be manually edited. It drives the programs Muscle or Clustal?W for multiple sequence alignment, and also allows to use any external alignment algorithm able to read and write FASTA-formatted files. It computes phylogenetic trees by parsimony using PHYLIP's dnapars/protpars algorithm, by distance with NJ or BioNJ algorithms on a variety of evolutionary distances, or by maximum likelihood using the program PhyML 3.0. SeaView draws phylogenetic trees on screen or PostScript files, and allows to download sequences from EMBL/GenBank/UniProt using the Internet."}}
