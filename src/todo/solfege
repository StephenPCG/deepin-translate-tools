{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Ear training software', 'pkgName': 'solfege', 'longDesc': u'GNU Solfege is an ear training program for X Window written in Python, using the GTK+ 2.0 libraries. You can practice harmonic and melodic intervals, chords, scales and rhythms, and you can add new exercises using a simple plain text file format.\n\nEar training is a big subject with many connections to music theory and performance of music, so I won\'t even try to make "a complete computer-based ear training course". But I hope someone find this software useful.'}}
