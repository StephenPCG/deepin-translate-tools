{'en': {'shortDesc': "port of the 1980's side-scrolling WWI dogfighting game", 'pkgName': 'sopwith', 'longDesc': u"This is an updated version of the 1980's game developed by David L. Clark of BMB Compuscience Canada - it has been adapted to run under *nix using the SDL toolkit. Poor graphics, stupid AI, and horrible sound await you. The gameplay is simple, addictive, and fun. A `side-scroller', you pilot your biplane across a static field, destorying enemy encampments and planes."}}
