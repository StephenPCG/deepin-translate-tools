{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A two deck solitaire game for the X Window System', 'pkgName': 'spider', 'longDesc': u'Spider is delivered in two forms: small.spider is for systems without high resolution screens so the board will fit on the screen; round.spider has prettier card backs but takes up more room on the screen.\n\nThe default is round.spider. If you wish to use small.spider, either call it directly, or change the link /usr/games/spider to point to small.spider instead of round.spider.'}}
