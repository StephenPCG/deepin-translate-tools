{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Tiny abstract black and white 2D cave-shooter', 'pkgName': 'spout', 'longDesc': u"This is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer Kuni. It is a 'caveflier' in which the exhaust from the engine serves also as a tool to erode the cave walls.\n\nYour goal is to fly upwards as long as you possibly can, without crashing against the cave walls and the window borders."}}
