{'en': {'shortDesc': 'application for creating 3D structures', 'pkgName': 'structure-synth', 'longDesc': u'Structure Synth is a tool for generating 3D structures by specifying a design grammar. Even simple systems may generate surprising and complex structures. Structure Synth offers a graphical environment with multiple tabs, syntax highlighting, and OpenGL preview. Integration with third-party renderers (such as Sunflow and POV-Ray) is possible using a flexible template based export system.\n\nStructure Synth is being developed by Mikael Hvidtfeldt Christensen. It was inspired by the CFDG syntax by Chris Coyne, and the Context Free Art GUI by Mark Lentczner and John Horigan.'}}
