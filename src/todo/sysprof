{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A system-wide Linux profiler', 'pkgName': 'sysprof', 'longDesc': u"Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a Linux kernel module to profile the entire system, not just a single application. Sysprof handles shared libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. In fact they don't even have to be restarted.\n\nIt has the following features:\n- profiles all running processes, not just a single application\n- has a simple graphical interface\n- shows the time spent in each branch of the call tree\n- profiles can be loaded and saved\nYou need the sysprof kernel module (provided in sysprof-module-source) to use sysprof."}}
