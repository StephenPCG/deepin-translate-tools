{'en': {'shortDesc': 'miscellaneous utilities using DVIlib', 'pkgName': 'tex-guy', 'longDesc': u"This package contains several utilities useful for dealing with TeX DVI files.\n\ndvi2misc generates PostScript, PGM or images for EPSON ESC/Page and Ricoh RPDL printers from a TeX DVI.  It can be used as an DVI driver for those printers.\n\ndvifontlist displays a list of fonts used in a DVI file, while dvispecials displays a list of 'special' commands in a DVI file. dvipages shows the number of pages in a DVI file.\n\nxgdvi, spawx11 and spawg has been separated since they depend on X and/or GTK+ libraries.\n\nThis is a part of the TeX-Guy distribution."}}
