{'en': {'shortDesc': 'strike down super high-velocity swooping insects', 'pkgName': 'titanion', 'longDesc': u"Titanion is an abstract shooter game. While we fire with one button, the other one acts as a tractor ray to attract the enemies and take them to the combat line. The game in itself is quite simple, but with such graphics and playability that it's worth a try.\n\nTitanion is another gem among many by Kenta Cho."}}
