{'en': {'shortDesc': 'An OpenGL-based game of marbles through a labyrinth', 'pkgName': 'trackballs', 'longDesc': u"Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out.\n\nThis game is not intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather inspired by it. The game is also highly configurable by using a scripting extension (Guile) and it provides a simple editor by which new levels can easily be created.\n\nInstall the trackballs-music package for a soundtrack to be played during gameplay. For more information and screenshots of the game please see <http://trackballs.sourceforge.net>."}}
