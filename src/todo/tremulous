{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Aliens vs Humans, team based FPS game with elements of an RTS', 'pkgName': 'tremulous', 'longDesc': u'Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based First Person Shooter (FPS) game with elements of a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on both teams are able to build working structures in-game like a Real Time Strategy game. These structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning. The designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...\n\nPlayer advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a human, players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the "Armoury". The alien team advances quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able to evolve into a new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes available.\n\nThe overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This is achieved by not only killing the opposing players but also removing their ability to respawn by destroying their spawn structures.'}}
