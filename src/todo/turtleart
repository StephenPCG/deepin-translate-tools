{'en': {'shortDesc': 'a LOGO-like tool for teaching programming', 'pkgName': 'turtleart', 'longDesc': u'Turtle Art is an activity with a Logo-inspired graphical "turtle" that draws colorful art based on snap-together visual programming elements.\n\nTurtle Art is intended to be a stepping stone to the Logo programming language, but there are many restrictions compared to Logo. However, you can export your Turtle Art creations to Berkeley Logo.\n\nTurtle Art was initially written in Java, and reimplemented in Python. A modified Python version with additional features, Turtle Blocks, is under active development and is included in this package.\n\nThis package contains the files needed to use it as a standalone application.'}}
