{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) SIP Phone', 'pkgName': 'twinkle', 'longDesc': u'Soft-phone for making telephone calls using SIP over an IP network.\n\nTwinkle supports direct IP phone to IP phone communication or a network using a SIP proxy to route your calls.\n\nIn addition to making basic voice calls Twinkle provides you the following features regardless of the services that your VoIP service provider might offer.\n\n2 call appearances (lines)\nMultiple active call identities\nCustom ring tones\nCall Waiting\nCall Hold\n3-way conference calling\nMute\nCall redirection on demand\nCall redirection unconditional\nCall redirection when busy\nCall redirection no answer\nReject call redirection request\nBlind call transfer\nCall transfer with consultation (attended call transfer) (new)\nReject call transfer request\nCall reject\nRepeat last call\nDo not disturb\nAuto answer\nMessage Waiting Indication\nVoice mail speed dial\nUser definable scripts triggered on call events\n E.g. to implement selective call reject or distinctive ringing\nRFC 2833 DTMF events\nIn-band DTMF\nOut-of-band DTMF (SIP INFO)\nSTUN support for NAT traversal\nSend NAT keep alive packets when using STUN\nNAT traversal through static provisioning\nMissed call indication\nHistory of call detail records for incoming, outgoing, successful and missed\nDNS SRV support\nAutomatic fail-over to an alternate server if a server is unavailable\nOther programs can originate a call via Twinkle, e.g. call from address book\nSystem tray icon\nSystem tray menu to originate and answer calls while Twinkle stays hidden\nUser definable number conversion rules\nSimple address book\nSupport for UDP and TCP (new) as transport for SIP\nPresence\nInstant messaging\nSimple file transfer with instant message\nInstant message composition indication\nCommand line interface (CLI)\nVoIP security\nSecure voice communication by ZRTP/SRTP\nMD5 digest authentication support for all SIP requests\nAKAv1-MD5 digest authentication support for all SIP requests (new)\nIdentity hiding\nAudio codecs\nG.711 A-law (64 kbps payload, 8 kHz sampling rate)\nG.711 u-law (64 kbps payload, 8 kHz sampling rate)\nGSM (13 kbps payload, 8 kHz sampling rate)\nSpeex narrow band (15.2 kbps payload, 8 kHz sampling rate)\nSpeex wide band (28 kbps payload, 16 kHz sampling rate)\nSpeex ultra wide band (36 kbps payload, 32 kHz sampling rate)\nG.726 (16, 24, 32 or 40 kbps payload, 8 kHz sampling rate)\nFor all codecs the following preprocessing options are available to improve quality at the far end of a call.\nAutomatic gain control (AGC) (new)\nNoise reduction (new)\nVoice activity detection (VAD) (new)\nAcoustic echo control (AEC) [experimental] (new)\n'}}
