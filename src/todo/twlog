{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Logging program for hamradio operators', 'pkgName': 'twlog', 'longDesc': u'This GUI program records basic Ham log information. It is for day to day logging, not contesting.  There is no dup checking and contest related things like that.  My keyboard is where my logbook used to be, so why not use the computer to log QSOs!\n\nThe interface can be customized without re-compiling.  A resource file allows you to modify the menus for the bands, modes, etc. that you use.\n\nMost of the log entries can be made with a button press or a single key stroke.  It records the date, start and end times, call sign, band, mode, power, and signal reports.  There is also a field for general notes.\n\nA second window allows you to search and edit the log file, and a third window provides online help.  The help file can also be view with any unix command or editor at any time.'}}
