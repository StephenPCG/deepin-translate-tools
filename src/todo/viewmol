{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A graphical front end for computational chemistry programs.', 'pkgName': 'viewmol', 'longDesc': u"Viewmol is a graphical front end for computational chemistry programs. It is able to graphically aid in the generation of molecular structures for computations and to visualize their results.\n\nAt present Viewmol includes input filters for Discover, DMol3, Gamess, Gaussian 9x/03, Gulp, Mopac, PQS, Turbomole, and Vamp outputs as well as for PDB files. Structures can be saved as Accelrys' car-files, MDL files, and Turbomole coordinate files. Viewmol can generate input files for Gaussian 9x/03. Viewmol's file format has been added to OpenBabel so that OpenBabel can serve as an input as well as an output filter for coordinates."}}
