{'en': {'shortDesc': 'multimedia player and streamer', 'pkgName': 'vlc', 'longDesc': u"VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG2, MPEG4, DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, mp3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs, and multimedia streams from various network sources.\n\nVLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates the stream it reads and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves them through HTTP.\n\nVLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for most output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added by installing additional audio plugins (vlc-plugin-pulse, vlc-plugin-sdl) or video plugins (vlc-plugin-sdl, vlc-plugin-ggi, vlc-plugin-svgalib). There is also a web browser plugin in the mozilla-plugin-vlc package."}}
