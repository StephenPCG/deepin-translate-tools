{'en': {'shortDesc': 'graphical video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg', 'pkgName': 'winff', 'longDesc': u'WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg. It will convert almost any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert mpeg\'s, flv\'s, and mov\'s into avi\'s (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp etc.) all at once.\n\nThis package provides a variety of preset conversion settings for common formats and devices. These presets are intended to hit the "sweet spot" for each individual codec. They have been written with a tip of the balance to quality.\n\nFor most presets to work, it is necessary to have the unstripped version of the libavcodec in the multiverse repository, which can be obtained by installing libavcodec-extra-## as suggested by this package.'}}
