{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Nendo-inspired 3D polygon mesh modeller', 'pkgName': 'wings3d', 'longDesc': u'Wings 3D is a polygon mesh modeller written entirely in Erlang.  The user interface was designed to be easy to use for both beginners and advanced users alike.  It was inspired by the famous Nendo modeller (from Izware.)\n\nUnlike similar modelling programs (such as Blender), this program does not provide native support for doing animations (though you can output its models to an animation tool.)\n\nWings 3D supports the following import formats: Nendo (NDO), 3D Studio (3DS), Wavefront (OBJ), and Adobe Illustrator 8 (AI).\n\nWings 3D supports the following export formats: Nendo (NDO), 3D Studio (3DS), Wavefront (OBJ), VRML (WRL), Renderman (RIB), Hash:Animation Master (MDL), Renderware (RWX), Yafray, Toxic, and FBX via a third-party plug-in.\n\nOpen Source Erlang is a functional programming language designed at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory.'}}
