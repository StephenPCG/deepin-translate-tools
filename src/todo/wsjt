{'en': {'shortDesc': 'weak-signal amateur radio communications', 'pkgName': 'wsjt', 'longDesc': u'WSJT is designed to facilitate Amateur Radio communication under extreme weak-signal conditions.  Three very different coding and modulation methods are provided: one for communication by "meteor scatter" techniques on the VHF bands; one for meteor and ionospheric scatter, primarily on the 6 meter band; and one for the very challenging EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) path.'}}
