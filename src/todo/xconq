{'en': {'shortDesc': 'A graphical multi-player strategy game and game design system', 'pkgName': 'xconq', 'longDesc': u"Xconq is an Empire-type strategy game, where each player contests for domination of a simulated world.  Unlike most empire-building games, it features a programming language that game designers can use to build a wide variety of games.\n\nGames already in the distribution's library include everything from simple combat, to elaborate world models, to silly but fun games, with time periods ranging from ancient history into the distant future."}}
