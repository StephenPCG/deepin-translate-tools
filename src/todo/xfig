{'en': {'shortDesc': 'Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11', 'pkgName': 'xfig', 'longDesc': u'XFig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed on postscript printers, or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to allow inclusion in LaTeX documents or web pages) using the transfig program.\n\nThis package contains the xfig program itself.\n\nYou should think about installing the transfig package to export the graphics to several common formats.  You should also think about installing xfig-doc, which contains the documentation and xfig-libs, which contains several clip art libraries.'}}
