{'en': {'shortDesc': 'plot and animate data sets', 'pkgName': 'ygraph', 'longDesc': u'The ygraph tool graphs one-dimensional data or displays a time-series of one-dimensional data sets. It is an enhanced alternative to the xgraph utility and supports the same input format as xgraph.  Additionally, ygraph features:\n\n* animating multiple plots simultaneously and synchronously;\n* stepping back and forth through animations one frame at a time;\n* zooming, similar to xgraph but without opening a lot of new windows;\n* plotting derivatives;\n* subtracting plots;\n* convergence tests;\n* reading compressed files;\n* exporting images and animations.\n'}}
